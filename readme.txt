AUGMENT EXPERIENCES WITH A SAFER, SIMPLER AND MORE PRIVATE WAY TO LOGIN

== Description ==

A paradigm shift in the registration and sign-in process, Affinidi Login is a game-changing solution for developers. With our revolutionary passwordless authentication solution your user's first sign-in doubles as their registration, and all the necessary data for onboarding can be requested during this streamlined sign-in/signup process. End users are in full control, ensuring that they consent to the information shared in a transparent and user-friendly manner. This streamlined approach empowers developers to create efficient user experiences with data integrity, enhanced security and privacy, and ensures compatibility with industry standards.

= Passwordless Authentication =

Offers a secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based authentication by eliminating passwords and thus removing the vulnerability to password-related attacks such as phishing and credential stuffing.

= Decentralised Identity Management =

Leverages OID4VP to enable users to control their data and digital identity, selectively share their credentials and authenticate themselves across multiple platforms and devices without relying on a centralised identity provider.

= Uses Latest Standards =

Utilises OID4VP to enhance security of the authentication process by verifying user authenticity without the need for direct communication with the provider, reducing risk of tampering and ensuring data integrity.
